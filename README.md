üìä **SQL-Based Data Analysis & Visualization Projects**
Welcome to the SQL-Based Data Analysis & Visualization repository! This space showcases end-to-end data projects where I utilize SQL for querying, cleaning, and transforming data extracted from Microsoft Excel files, followed by creating insightful dashboards and visualizations using Microsoft Power BI and Tableau.

üîç **Project Overview**
Each project in this repository follows a structured Data Analysis Lifecycle:

3. Data extracted or imported for further transformation and analysis.

**2. Data Cleaning & Transformation** 
1. Tool: SQL (using platforms like MySQL, Sql Server Management Studio)

**Activities**: 
  1. Handling nulls, duplicates, and incorrect types
  2. Standardizing formats
  3. Creating calculated fields, joins, filters, and aggregations

**3. Data Analysis & Exploration**
1. Exploratory queries for understanding trends, distributions, KPIs
2. Deriving business insights through advanced SQL logic (CTEs, subqueries, window functions)

**4. Visualization & Dashboarding** 
1. Tools: Power BI / Tableau
2. Creating dynamic dashboards to:
